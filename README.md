# BHARAT-INTERN-HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION
House price prediction using linear regression is a classic machine learning task where we use the linear regression algorithm to predict the prices of houses based on certain input features. The input features could be various factors that affect the price of a house, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

Here's a step-by-step guide to performing house price prediction using linear regression in Python:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset that includes the relevant features (inputs) and the corresponding house prices (output). You can find real estate datasets online or through data repositories.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data and handle any missing values or outliers. Ensure that the dataset is in a format suitable for linear regression, with numerical features and a numerical target variable (house price).

3. **Feature Selection**: If there are many features, consider selecting the most relevant ones that are likely to have a significant impact on the house price. Feature selection helps in improving the model's performance and reduces overfitting.

4. **Split the Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the linear regression model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

5. **Training the Linear Regression Model**: Use the training data to fit the linear regression model. The algorithm will learn the coefficients for each feature, and the model will be able to make predictions based on these learned coefficients.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using the testing set. Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.

7. **Model Improvement**: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you can try different approaches to improve it, such as adding more relevant features, trying different regression algorithms, or tuning hyperparameters.

8. **Prediction**: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen house data to estimate their prices.

Here's a simple Python code snippet to get you started with the implementation:


Make sure to replace "feature1", "feature2", ... with the actual feature names from your dataset, and "house_price" with the correct target variable name.

Keep in mind that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. If the relationship is more complex, you might need to explore more sophisticated regression techniques or use more advanced algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
